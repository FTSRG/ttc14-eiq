Movie Database Case for the TTC 2014
====================================
Social networks and other web 2.0 platforms use huge amounts of data to offer
new services to customers. Often this data can be expressed as huge graphs
and thus could be seen as a potential new application field for model
transformations. However, this application area requires that model
transformation tools scale to models with millions of objects. This
transformation case targets this application area by using the IMDb movie
database as a model. The transformation deals with identifying all actor
couples which perform together in a set of at least three movies.
