\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have presented our implementation of the Movie Database Case. The solution is based on \incquery{} which is used as a model query engine. Because its dedicated rule language is yet to be implemented, the transformation rules are defined in Xtend.

The transformation is specified using declarative graph pattern queries over EMF models for rule preconditions, and Xtend code which can be executed to obtain the desired effect of the rule.
