\begin{abstract}
  Social networks and other web 2.0 platforms use huge amounts of data
  to offer new services to customers. Often these data can be
  expressed as huge graphs and thus could be seen as a potential new
  application field for model transformations. Automotive software is
  an existing application area for model-driven software engineering
  is and its models approach also huge sizes. Both these application
  areas require that model transformation tools scale to models with
  millions of nodes and edges. This transformation case uses the IMBDB
  movie database as a model with such a size. The transformation deals
  with identifying all cliques of $n$ actors which perform in the same movie.

\section{Introduction (MTT)}


\section{Detailed Case Description (MTT)}

MM and data\\

The transformation is on data from a movie database.
We use the metamodel shown in Figure~\ref{fig:metamodel}.
We generate synthetic test data and also use real data
from the IMDB movie database. You can use the EMF model and
parser provided in \cite{IMDB2EMF} for this purpose.

\subsection{Task 1: Generating Test Data (CK)}
\label{sec:gen-test-data}

The first task is to generate some test data.
This will be used to test the correctness and to do benchmarks later.
The generation of the test data should go as follows...
A graphical Henshin specification is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gen-test-data}

\subsection{Task 2: Finding Couples (CK)}

Implementation of the task

\subsection{Task 3: Computing Average Rankings (CK)}

%% - Couples sorted by their average rating
%% - Couples sorted by the number of common movies

Implementation of the task

\subsection{Extension Task 1: Compute Top Ten Couples (TH)}

\subsection{Extension Task 2: Finding Cliques (TH)}

%% Create a Clique node for every set of at least N Persons that act together
%% in at least C Movies.  This is a generalization of Task 2 where a Couple is
%% essentially a Clique for N = 2 and C = 3.  (Possibly, we let C fixed at 3.)
%%
%% Possible solution alternatives: (a) somehow have N and C as parameters to
%% the transformation, or (b) have a higher-order transformation that gets N
%% and C and generates a rule for that combination.

\subsection{Extension Task 3: Compute Average Rankings for Cliques (TH)}

\subsection{Extension Task 4: Compute Top Ten Cliques (TH)}

%% Same queries as for Task 3, except they are for Cliques rather than for
%% Couples.


\section{Evaluation Criteria (MTT)}

Test data from December 2013. Contact us to get the data.

\subsection{Correctness Tests (TH)}

Correctness is checked using the synthetic data.

We provide: number of couples and top ten lists.

\subsection{Benchmarks (CK)}

Perform benchmarks using the following input data sets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the synthetic data generated in Section~\ref{sec:gen-test-data}, and 
\item the IMDB data (available at \cite{IMDBDATA}; parse, e.g., using \cite{IMDB2EMF}).
\end{enumerate}
For both cases, you should run the transformation and measure 
the time needed to complete the transformation (without loading 
and saving the model).

There are two versions of the transformations: Finding Couple and Finding Cliques.
Please run the benchmarks for both versions and both data sets.

%% Tassilo: Why not measuring Task 2 on its own?

Plot the benchmarks. On the x-axis you print the size of the data set
in number of nodes and on the y-axis you plot the time. The number of nodes
includes all types of nodes (movies and persons). Make the measurements in
steps of 100,000 nodes. For the synthetic data, choose n=?,...,?
For the IMDB data, take the whole data set and to sampling. You can use
the sampler provided in \cite{IMDB2EMF}. 

NOTE TO US: IMPLEMENT SAMPLING!
