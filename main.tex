\begin{abstract}
  Social networks and other web 2.0 platforms use huge amounts of data
  to offer new services to customers. Often these data can be
  expressed as huge graphs and thus could be seen as a potential new
  application field for model transformations. However, this
  application area requires that model transformation tools scale to
  models with millions of objects. This transformation case targets
  this application area by using the IMBDB movie database as a
  model. The transformation deals with identifying all cliques of $n$
  actors which perform in the same movies.

\section{Introduction (MTT)}

The driving force behind social networks and other new web 2.0
offerings is often huge amount of data. Consequently, concepts like
MapReduce \cite{Dean08} and libraries like Hadoop \cite{Hadoop} and
Giraph \cite{Giraph} have been developed to efficiently process these
huge amount of data. However, model transformation approaches have so
far not adressed this field.

Automotive software is an already well-established application field
for model-driven software engineering and its models approach also
huge sizes. As a consequence from these two examples, model
transformation approaches must be scalable to models with million
objects to be applicable for these application areas.

We present in the following a case which uses the IMDB movie database
\cite{IMDBDATA} as a data source. The IMDB movie database contains
information about movies, actors performing in the movies, movie
ratings, etc. The main task is to develop a model transformation which
identifies \emph{all} cliques of $n$ actors which perform in the same
movies and calculate the average rating of those movies. Evaluation
criteria are correctness and performance.

In the following section, we describe the case in more detail
including the meta model as well as the different basic and extension
tasks. After that, Section \ref{sec-eval} presents the evaluation
criteria for submitted solutions to this case.


\section{Detailed Case Description (MTT)}\label{sec-case}

MM and data\\

The transformation is on data from a movie database.
We use the metamodel shown in Figure~\ref{fig:metamodel}.
We generate synthetic test data and also use real data
from the IMDB movie database. You can use the EMF model and
parser provided in \cite{IMDB2EMF} for this purpose.

\subsection{Task 1: Generating Test Data (CK)}
\label{sec:gen-test-data}

The first task is to generate some test data.
This will be used to test the correctness and to do benchmarks later.
The generation of the test data should go as follows...
A graphical Henshin specification is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gen-test-data}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Task 2: Finding Couples (CK)}

Implementation of the task

\subsection{Task 3: Computing Average Rankings (CK)}

%% - Couples sorted by their average rating
%% - Couples sorted by the number of common movies

Implementation of the task

\subsection{Extension Task 1: Compute Top Ten Couples (TH)}

\subsection{Extension Task 2: Finding Cliques (TH)}

%% Create a Clique node for every set of at least N Persons that act together
%% in at least C Movies.  This is a generalization of Task 2 where a Couple is
%% essentially a Clique for N = 2 and C = 3.  (Possibly, we let C fixed at 3.)
%%
%% Possible solution alternatives: (a) somehow have N and C as parameters to
%% the transformation, or (b) have a higher-order transformation that gets N
%% and C and generates a rule for that combination.

\subsection{Extension Task 3: Compute Average Rankings for Cliques (TH)}

\subsection{Extension Task 4: Compute Top Ten Cliques (TH)}

%% Same queries as for Task 3, except they are for Cliques rather than for
%% Couples.


\section{Evaluation Criteria (MTT)}\label{sec-eval}

Test data from December 2013. Contact us to get the data.

\subsection{Correctness Tests (TH)}

Correctness is checked using the synthetic data.

We provide: number of couples and top ten lists.

\subsection{Benchmarks (CK)}

Perform benchmarks using the following input data sets:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the synthetic data generated in Section~\ref{sec:gen-test-data}, and 
\item the IMDB data (available at \cite{IMDBDATA}; parse, e.g., using \cite{IMDB2EMF}).
\end{enumerate}
For both cases, you should run the transformation and measure 
the time needed to complete the transformation (without loading 
and saving the model).

There are two versions of the transformations: Finding Couple and Finding Cliques.
Please run the benchmarks for both versions and both data sets.

%% Tassilo: Why not measuring Task 2 on its own?

Plot the benchmarks. On the x-axis you print the size of the data set
in number of nodes and on the y-axis you plot the time. The number of nodes
includes all types of nodes (movies and persons). Make the measurements in
steps of 100,000 nodes. For the synthetic data, choose n=?,...,?
For the IMDB data, take the whole data set and to sampling. You can use
the sampler provided in \cite{IMDB2EMF}. 

NOTE TO US: IMPLEMENT SAMPLING!
